## Databases - Universitat Pompeu Fabra

This repository contains my group deliverables for the **Databases** course, a third-year subject in the Bachelor's degree on *Mathematical Engineering on Data Science* at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona. The deliverables in this repository correspond to the **2024 edition** of the course.

### Project Details

The repository includes the **challenges** completed in group lab sessions, with contributions from myself, **Irene Escofet**, and **Isabel Exp√≥sito**.

### Challenge 1

In Challenge 1, we were tasked with designing and implementing a database based on the instructors' requirements. The deliverables for this challenge included:
1. **Conceptual Model**: An Entity-Relation (ER) diagram for the database.
2. **Relational Model**: A relational structure derived from the conceptual model.
3. **SQL Implementation**: A `.sql` file containing the code to create the database on the server.

### Challenge 2

In Challenge 2, we were tasked with creating new tables, importing data, writing and refining queries, and implementing new database requirements. These requirements included creating procedures, triggers, and event structures. The deliverables for this challenge included:
1. **Data Loading**: `challenge2-load-data.sql` for creating tables and importing data.
2. **Query Writing**: `challenge2-queries.sql` for the queries.
3. **Advanced Features**: Separate files for each new requirement, such as `challenge2-req01.sql`, `challenge2-req02.sql`, etc.
